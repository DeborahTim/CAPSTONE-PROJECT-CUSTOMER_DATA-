## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this phase, we undertake several critical actions:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: We begin by loading the dataset and performing an initial inspection to understand its structure and contents.


2. Handling Missing Variables: We address any missing values in the dataset to ensure completeness and accuracy.


3. Data Cleaning and Formatting: We clean the data by correcting inconsistencies and formatting it to meet analytical standards.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involves exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:
